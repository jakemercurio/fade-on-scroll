# jquery-fade-on-scroll
Adjust the opacity of an item as it scrolls off the top of the page. The element will reach 0% opacity just before it scrolls out of view, and the opacity will reach 100% again once the entire element is visible again.

## Usage

Add the class `fade-on-scroll` to any html element that you'd like to fade as it scrolls out of view.

```html
<div class="fade-on-scroll">
  <h1>Text that will fade as it scrolls of the page</h1>
</div>
```
